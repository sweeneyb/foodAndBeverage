- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1/2 cup sugar (115g)
- 1 vanilla bean
- 5 egg yolks
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 12 teaspoons granulated sugar, for topping

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
2. Pour heavy cream and milk into a saucepan, then add sugar.
3. Split vanilla bean and scrape seeds into cream. Drop vanilla bean pod into cream as well.
4. Heat over medium, whisking frequently to dissolve the sugar.
5. Turn off the heat when the cream just starts to steam and small bubbles start to form around the edges (about 5 minutes). Let cool for 2 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, add egg yolks to a large measuring cup with a spout and whisk until smooth.
7. Pour in a few ounces of the hot cream mixture while whisking. Continue whisking until well-combined.
8. Slowly pour the rest of the cream mixture into the egg yolks while stirring constantly.
9. Whisk in salt.
10. If the mixture looks particularly foamy, you can skim the foam off the top before pouring into ramekins so that you won’t have bubbles on the top of your custards.
11. Bring a kettle to boil with hot water.
12. Fill 6 4-ounce ramekins with mixture, and put ramekins in a 9x13 baking dish. Put baking dish in oven.
13. Pour very hot water (just off the boil) around the ramekins, about 3/4 of the way up the sides.
14. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until custards are set, but still slightly jiggly in the middle.
15. Remove pan carefully from the oven. Then remove ramekins and place on cooling rack. Let cool until room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days.
16. When ready to serve, sprinkle 2 teaspoons sugar evenly over the top of each custard’s surface, covering completely.
17. Hold a kitchen blowtorch a couple of inches from the surface of the custard, and turn on. Caramelize the sugar by moving the blowtorch in circles over the custard until the sugar melts and browns.
18. Repeat for remaining custards.
19. Serve immediately, or put custards back in the refrigerator for up to an hour.
