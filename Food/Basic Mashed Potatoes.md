* 2 lbs baking potatoes.  Russet is fine, but yukon gold will make things creamier
* 1 cup milk
* 2 tbsp butter (and maybe another few tbsp)
* a lot of salt.  Pepper if desired

## Preparation
1. Cut potatoes into roughly 1/2 inch cubes.  Consistency is really helpful
2. boil for ~15 minutes.  Potatoes should easily pierce and seem a bit fluffy.  If they fall apart when stabbed, use less milk.
3. Drain off water, add potatoes back to the pot.  Heat off or on very low.
4. Throw in milk and butter.  Mash/mix.  Add salt and taste.  Add pepper if desired.

This is nice/basic for when you're having sensory overload.  I have a bottle of st elmo's horseradish sauce to give my portion some zing.  A sauted garlic butter addition would be nice, too.
