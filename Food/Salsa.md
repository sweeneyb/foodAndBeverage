* Roma Tomatoes – You’ll want two large roma tomatoes, chopped. 
- Diced Tomatoes – You’ll also need two cans of plain, diced tomatoes. 
- Jalapeños – Jalapeños hold their heat in the seeds so leave as many, or as few, as you want for this recipe. I seed mine.
- Lime Juice – Squeeze a fresh lime for the best taste. Cumin – Rich & earthy cumin adds depth to the salsa. 
- Minced Garlic – I always take a shortcut here and use minced garlic in olive oil. Fresh works as well. 
- White Onion – You’ll want to use a white onion for its sharp taste. 
- Salt – Of course. 
- Cayenne Pepper or Red Pepper Flakes – I always opt for red pepper flakes. Use as much, or as little, as you like for heat. 
- Cilantro – Fresh cilantro, chopped. You can get a bundle for a quarter. It’s cheap and flavorful.

## PREPARATION
- Chop everything into moderate chunks. 
- Put it in a blender and blend until smooth
