* Blood Orange Blister - Blood Orange Blonde Ale - 5.7% ABV
  *  Pass.  Good flavor, but a bit hazy.  Has that "drinking mud" mouthfeel that I'm not partial to
* Ginger Bread Basket -Gingerbread Imperial Stout - 10.8% ABV
  *  Pass.  Balanced towards alcohol heavy with a bit of ginger bread on the backend.  Better 1/2 way through.  
* Candle Of Thought -West Coast Pale Ale - 5% ABV
  * Okay. A bit of a musty hops flavor.  It's not bad, but kind of unremarkable.
